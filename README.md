[Project 1: Excel document using techniques such as formatting data, formulas, functions, validation, protection,
lookup tables and pivot tables](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UG-7avP7cXOY2ypmVMntaw-ipCC5fQLU/view?usp=sharing)


• On Worksheet1:
a) In cell A1, type: Northwest Stationery

• On Worksheet2. Under Subtotal, use an appropriate function to total sales from all
months for each customer from Worksheet1. 

• On Worksheet3, define the name of the Customer Loyalty Table appropriately using a
name.

• On Worksheet2, use an appropriate function to define the correct discount amount
from the lookup table on Worksheet3.

• On Worksheet2, calculate the new Total using an appropriate formula. This should be
calculated by Subtotal – Customer Loyalty Discount.

• On Worksheet2, indicate whether the customer is eligible for a Corporate Gift using an
appropriate IF function. See Worksheet3 - All customers earning a Customer Loyalty Discount of €200 or
greater, are eligible for a Corporate Gift (cell B12).

• On Worksheet4, use an appropriate function to populate cells H3:H12 with the
corresponding postal address in the format Forename, Surname, Street Address, Town,
County, Eircode.

• On Worksheet4, sensitive customer data must be appropriately protected to ensure
that addresses are not erroneously altered/deleted. Protect the worksheet cell range
A3:H12 so that data cannot be altered.
